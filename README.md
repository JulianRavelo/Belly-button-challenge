# Belly-button-challenge
## Scope
In this assignment, we were given a JSON dataset accessible from a URL with the task of create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.  
By using Javascript, its D3 library, and HTML, a website was created to have a bar chart, a bubble chart and some demographic information each time an ID value is selected from a dropdown list.  
## Results
See below some images of the resultant dashboard:
